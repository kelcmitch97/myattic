## Description
At thereWillBeCodeToo our mission for *MyAttic* is to provide an ecommerce service...
- for those downsizing or looking for help to sell no-longer-needed items, and... 
- for those wanting to find classic, charming, and hard-to-find items in an online environment.

MyAttic provides a widely-needed public service to connect communities to help reduce waste and repurpose 'stuff'. 
People--from millennials to seniors--moving to smaller living spaces look for services to help them through what can be a stressful process of letting go of some things. 
And those who find themselves inheriting the stuff of family and friends seek help to be selective in retaining those sentimental and valued items that can continue to be useful, while needing a service that can help them sell no-longer-needed items to others who may be seeking a wide variety of things.

## User Story
- AS A PERSON who is downsizing myself or because I inherited stuff from others that will not fit into my current living conditions
